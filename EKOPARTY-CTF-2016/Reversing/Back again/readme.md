The same trick used in Old times worked here, too, except this time the bytes were scrambled around a bit. I just had to manually rearrange things with my eyeballs. Love when that happens. I didn't even have to go back in time to the 80's and ask the bank if I could borrow their AS/400.

Surprisingly few people solved this, given that you could basically do this by dumping the file and eyeballing for strings.
